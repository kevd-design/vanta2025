# Optimal Combined Approach for Accessibility Processing

This plan combines client-side calculations with server-side Sanity integration, offering a phased implementation strategy:

## PHASE 1: Create Core Utilities (Week 1)

- Implement `calculatePerceptualLuminance()` using WCAG-compliant formulas
- Create `calculateContrast()` for accurate contrast ratios
- Build `calculateColorVariance()` for analyzing image complexity
- Develop `getSamplePointsDistribution()` for targeted sampling

## PHASE 2: Client-Side Improvements (Week 2)

- Create DirectSampler class to replace grid-based sampling:
  - Implement `analyzeElement()` for element-specific sampling
  - Add `getTextRecommendation()` with fallback mechanisms
  - Fix DPR handling issues with explicit scaling

## PHASE 3: Sanity Integration (Week 3-4)

- Create SanityImageProcessor for CMS integration:
  - Implement `enhanceImageOnUpload()` to process images at upload time
  - Add schema extensions for accessibility data
  - Set up webhooks for automated processing

## PHASE 4: Server-Side Processing (Week 4-5)

- Build ServerAnalysisService for efficient backend processing:
  - Create `analyzeImageRegions()` using Sharp
  - Implement caching strategy for analysis results
  - Add revalidation endpoints for content updates

## PHASE 5: Hybrid Component System (Week 5-6)

- Create AccessibleTextComponent as Server Component:
  - Use pre-analyzed data from Sanity when available
  - Fall back to client-side analysis for dynamic content
  - Implement AdaptiveTextStyle with palette integration
  - Use PaletteOverlay for better visual design

## PHASE 6: Debug Tools (Week 6-7)

- Enhance DebugVisualizer with improved diagnostics:
  - Add `renderSamplingPoints()` to show actual sample points
  - Create palette visualization for Sanity data
  - Display WCAG compliance indicators for contrast ratios

## PHASE 7: Transition Strategy (Week 8)

- Implement a hybrid approach for gradual migration:
  1. Add Sanity metadata to existing image assets
  2. Maintain current client system for backward compatibility 
  3. Add server preprocessing for static content
  4. Integrate palette-based overlays
  5. Phase out grid-based system as server components take over
  6. Create accessibility reporting interface

## Key Benefits

This approach provides:

1. Immediate client-side improvements with WCAG compliance
2. Better performance through server-side processing
3. Enhanced aesthetics with palette-aware design
4. Improved editorial experience in Sanity Studio
5. Consistent accessibility across both static and dynamic content

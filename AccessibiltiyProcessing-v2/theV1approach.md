# Current Method of Ensuring Accessible Colors

The v1 system uses a multi-stage approach to determine optimal text colors for accessibility over images:

## Core Components

1. **Image Color Sampling** (`useImageColorMap`)
   - Creates a grid-based representation of image colors
   - Samples colors across the entire image
   - Calculates luminance for each grid cell using basic RGB formula (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B)

2. **Element Position Tracking** (`useElementMap`)
   - Maps UI elements (like text) to specific grid cells
   - Creates a spatial representation of where elements appear over the image
   - Uses ResizeObserver to stay accurate when dimensions change

3. **Accessibility Analysis** (`useAccessibilityMap`)
   - Analyzes color cells that overlap with UI elements
   - Uses a voting system to determine if black or white text is more readable
   - Applies a consensus threshold (95% by default) for decision making

4. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - When consensus isn't reached, applies `background` designation
   - This triggers a semi-transparent black background behind text
   - Ensures readability even on complex image backgrounds

5. **Debug Visualization** (`AccessibilityDebug`)
   - Shows the grid, element positions, and color analysis
   - Displays viewport position and scrolling information
   - Provides diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

## Workflow

1. An image is loaded via `OptimizedImage` component
2. The image is analyzed to create a color map grid
3. Elements (like headlines) are positioned and mapped to the grid
4. The `useAccessibilityMap` hook analyzes which cells overlap with elements
5. For each element, votes are tallied to decide on black or white text
6. If consensus is high (>95%), use the winning color directly
7. If consensus is low, fall back to adding a background behind text
8. The `ImageContainer` component orchestrates this process and applies CSS classes
9. React components like `HeroContent` consume these classes to style text

## Key Features

- **Client-Side Processing**: All calculations happen in the browser
- **Responsive**: Recalculates on resize, scroll, and other layout changes
- **Defensive Design**: Provides fallbacks for ambiguous cases
- **Visual Debugging**: Comprehensive tools for development and testing
- **Component Isolation**: Each component handles its own accessibility

This approach effectively addresses accessibility by ensuring text is readable against variable image backgrounds, though it does this through client-side processing and basic luminance calculations rather than using more advanced perceptual models or server-side precomputation.

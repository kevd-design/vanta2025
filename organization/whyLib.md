# Why Types and Utils Should Live Inside lib

Placing types and utilities inside a `lib` directory offers several key advantages for your project architecture:

## 1. Separation of Concerns

The `lib` folder creates a clear boundary between different categories of code:

- **Components**: UI elements and their specific logic
- **Hooks**: State management and behaviors
- **Context**: Application-wide state management
- **lib**: Core business logic, utilities, and type definitions

This separation makes it immediately clear what kind of code you're dealing with when looking at a file path.

## 2. Better Abstraction Layers

A well-designed application follows the principle of layered architecture:

```
UI Layer (components) → Logic Layer (lib) → Data Layer (API/services)
```

By moving types and utils into `lib`, you create a proper middle layer that:

- Acts as a bridge between UI components and data
- Provides reusable functionality without UI dependencies
- Keeps UI components focused on presentation rather than business logic

## 3. Enhanced Reusability

Code in the `lib` directory:

- Has **fewer dependencies** on other parts of your application
- Is more **easily portable** to other projects
- Is **tested in isolation** from UI-specific concerns

By isolating utility functions and types, they become more reusable across your application and potentially in future projects.

## 4. Cleaner Import Paths

With types and utils in `lib`, your import statements become more intuitive:

```typescript
// Before
import { SanityImageObject } from '../../types/image'
import { calculateDimensions } from '../../utils/imageDimensions'

// After
import { SanityImageObject } from '@/lib/types/image'
import { calculateDimensions } from '@/lib/utils/imageDimensions'
```

The `lib/` prefix in imports signals "this is core functionality" rather than a UI component.

## 5. Easier Tree-Shaking

Modern bundlers can better optimize imports from a proper `lib` directory:

- More reliable tree-shaking (removing unused code)
- Clear boundaries for code splitting
- Better module resolution

## 6. More Maintainable TypeScript Configuration

Your TypeScript path configuration becomes simpler:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@/lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This structure creates a consistent pattern for your imports.

## 7. Better Documentation and Discovery

When types live in a central `lib/types` folder:

- New developers can quickly discover all available types
- Documentation tools can more easily generate comprehensive type documentation
- It's easier to maintain cross-domain type relationships

## 8. Future-Proofing

As your application grows, keeping utilities and types in `lib` scales better:

- **API Changes**: Easier to adapt when backend APIs evolve
- **Design System Evolution**: UI components can change without affecting business logic
- **Code Refactoring**: Types and utilities remain stable when refactoring UI components

## Real-World Example

Consider a scenario where you're implementing image color analysis:

```typescript
// In a component-focused structure:
import { calculateImageColors } from '../../utils/imageUtils'
import type { ImagePalette } from '../../types/image'

// In a lib-focused structure:
import { calculateImageColors } from '@/lib/utils/imageUtils'
import type { ImagePalette } from '@/lib/types/image'
```

When you need to use this across multiple components, the `lib` structure makes it immediately clear that this is core functionality, not component-specific code.

This organization promotes a "core first, UI second" approach, which leads to more maintainable codebases, especially as they grow larger.

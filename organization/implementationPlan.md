## Migration Strategy

1. **Start with the Debug Folder**: Create the debug directory first and move all debug-related code there
2. **Add Your TextBackground Component**: Implement it in the new structure 
3. **Reorganize Components**: Move existing components to their proper locations
4. **Update Import Paths**: Update imports throughout the application
5. **Create Barrel Files**: Add index.ts files that re-export components for easier importing

This structure provides a clear roadmap for maintainable organization of your codebase, with special consideration for your sophisticated debug tooling and palette-aware components like the TextBackground you're implementing.
